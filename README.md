📍 **The Process**
I wanted to build something **practical** with Spring Boot while learning how to connect the backend and frontend. Most to-do list apps I saw online were either pure frontend or too complex, so I set out to make one that's simple, structured, and actually works end-to-end.  

I started with a basic CRUD structure (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Spring Boot and JPA. Then I used Thymeleaf for the views — it allowed me to render dynamic HTML easily. Finally, I styled everything with Bootstrap to make it look neat.  

The most fun part? Adding the **strike-through animation** when tasks are completed — it gives a satisfying "done" feeling ✅.
