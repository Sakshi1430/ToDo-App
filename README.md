## 📍 Project Overview
This project was built to create a **practical Spring Boot application** that connects **backend and frontend** seamlessly.  
Most online To-Do List apps were either pure frontend or too complex, so this project focuses on being **simple, structured, and functional end-to-end**.

**Development Steps:**  
1. Built a basic **CRUD structure** (Create, Read, Delete) using Spring Boot and JPA.  
2. Rendered dynamic HTML with **Thymeleaf**.  
3. Styled the UI using **Bootstrap** for a clean and responsive layout.  
4. Added a **strike-through animation** for completed tasks to make it visually satisfying ✅.
